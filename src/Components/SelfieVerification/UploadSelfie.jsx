                  A Loan Agreement, also known as a term loan, demand loan, or a
                  loan contract, is a contract that documents a financial
                  agreement between two parties, where one is the lender and the
                  other is the borrower.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  This contract specifies the amount of the loan, any interest
                  charges, the repayment plan, and payment dates.<br></br>A
                  written contract gives both the borrower and lender a clear
                  outline of the terms of the loan.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If the borrower dies before paying off the loan, authorities
                  will use their assets to pay the remainder of the debt.
                  <br></br>
                  If there is a co-signer, the responsibility for the debt falls
                  to them.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The borrower may secure the loan with collateral such as a
                  vehicle, equipment, or jewellery.<br></br>
                  In this case, the lender may seize the collateral if the
                  borrower cannot repay the full loan amount.<br></br>
                  The lender may also require the borrower to obtain insurance
                  if using the loan to buy a vehicle.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The borrower repays the entire loan amount at once (either by
                  a specific date or upon notice to repay).
                </p>
